print("\n")

## OK, that's a list! Hmm. What's the type of the first element in it?
print(type(results["statuses"][0]), "is the type of the first element in the results")
## OK, that's a dictionary. What are its keys? I have a suspicion they'll be the same as the Tweet dictionary I saw before...
## I'm gonna assign that one tweet to a variable to make it easier.
umich_tweet = results["statuses"][0]
## Now, what are its keys?
print("\nThe keys of the tweet dictionary:")
print(umich_tweet.keys())

## And the list of tweets is in results["statuses"]..
list_of_umich_tweets = results["statuses"]

## Iterate over the tweets you get back...
## And print the text of each one!
for tweet in list_of_umich_tweets:
    print(tweet["text"])
    print("\n")

## Note that there are a bunch of options in the search you can try -- to get more tweets, etc. But for now, look at how much you can access with the basics.

## Here's code to update a status -- uncomment below lines if you fill them in to post something to Twitter
# stat_text = "" # A string for what you want to be posted on your twitter account
# ## Uncomment the following line to post a new status
# api.update_status(stat_text)
